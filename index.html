            You already know that I love you a lot, but the truth is, the love I have for you is infinite.
            Every moment I spend with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.
            You‚Äôre not just my favorite person ‚Äî you‚Äôre the reason I smile without any reason.
            You used to say I love you, but not that much... but trust me, I do. I just don‚Äôt know how to express it
            all.
            You mean more to me than words could ever say. Loving you is the easiest thing I‚Äôve ever done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at you is the best kind of peace I ever have. <br>

I love talking to you, even, I have nothing to say.. <br>

You're the one who lives in my heart and prayers.. <br>

My eyes adores you. But it's my soul that fell in love with you.. <br>

I get jealous because I'm afraid what if someone makes you more happier than I do.. <br>

Trust me, you're the first girl I loved with all my heart.. <br>

Actually I don't have words to explain the love I have for you.. <br>

I wish, you could see yourself through my eyes then you could understand why do I love you that much, why do I can't define the reason behind not giving up loving you. <br>
I mean you're such a girl every boys dreamed to have as their wife... your voice(it makes my dayyyy))) <br>
Your chuckles!!! I can do everything to see that just for onc ee....<br>
And what would I say about your eyes.... you may say I'm flirting but trust me your eyes are  so powerful. It has power to rule a bad guy like mee.<br>
If there was a chance to ask one thing for rest of the life, I surely had asked God for having the ability to stare at those ocean( Your eyes obviously) for rest of the lifeeüòå <br>
My eyes will never tired of¬†staring¬†at¬†you‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="color-black">
            So always remember: All the angels have wings, but you have something more precious ‚Äî me(SHEYAM).
            And even that ‚Äúme‚Äù only becomes precious when it belongs to **you**.
